		<h2>Step 1: Screening</h2>
		<img src="images/S1.jpeg" alt="Step 1" width="200px" >
		<p>Wastewater enters the plant and goes through a process called screening. Here, large objects such as branches, plastics, and other debris are removed by using mechanical screens.

        </p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Step 2: Removal</h2>
		<img src="images/S2.jpg" alt="Step 2" width="450px">
		<p>After screening, the wastewater goes through a grit chamber. Here, small and heavy particles such as sand, gravel, and other inorganic materials are removed through sedimentation</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Step 3: Primary Sedimentation</h2>
		<img src="images/S3.jpg" alt="Step 3" width="450px">
		<p> The wastewater then enters a primary sedimentation tank, where the suspended solids are allowed to settle to the bottom of the tank. These solids are removed by scrapers, while the remaining liquid, called effluent, flows to the next stage</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Step 4: Biological Treatment</h2>
		<img src="images/S4.jpeg" alt="Step 4" width="450px">
		<p>In this stage, microorganisms such as bacteria, protozoa, and fungi are added to the effluent in a biological reactor. The microorganisms consume the organic matter and nutrients present in the effluent, effectively breaking down the pollutants into harmless by-products</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Step 5: Secondary Sedimentation</h2>
        <img src="images/S5.jpeg" alt="Step 5" width="450px">
        <p>After biological treatment, the wastewater enters a secondary sedimentation tank, where the remaining solids are allowed to settle out. This is followed by the removal of the solids using scrapers.</p>

    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Step 6: Disinfection </h2>
        <img src="images/S6.jpeg" alt="Step 6" width="450px">
        <p>In this stage, the effluent is disinfected using chemicals such as chlorine or ultraviolet light to kill any remaining pathogens or disease-causing organisms. This makes the water safe for discharge into the environment.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Step 7: Sludge Treatement</h2>
        <img src="images/S7.jpeg"alt="Step 7" width="450px">
        <p>The solids removed from the primary and secondary sedimentation tanks are treated separately in a process called sludge treatment. Here, the solids are thickened and dewatered, with the excess water removed. The resulting sludge can be used as a fertilizer or disposed of in a landfill.

        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Step 8: Discharge</h2>
        <img src="images/S8.jpeg" alt="Step 8" width="450px">
        <p>The treated effluent is finally discharged into the environment, either into a river or a lake, depending on the plant's location and the regulatory requirements</p>
